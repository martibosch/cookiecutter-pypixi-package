## Pull request guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
1. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.md.
1. Install [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) and use it to work in the project environments, for example `pixi install -e dev`, `pixi run -e test test`, and `pixi run -e doc build-doc`.
1. Commit `pixi.lock` after resolving dependencies, and include updates to it in pull requests whenever dependency changes require a new solve.
1. The pull request should work for Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13. Check https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_username }}/{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}/actions and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
